if you are reading this in english then you are reading the plaintext of the
first assignment in our cryptography course. this assignment was supposedly
posted two days before the end of the eighth month in the year of twenty
fourteen. as you have discovered by cracking this assignment, it was
encrypted using a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher. for this
assignment submit the following items by email at least before the third
week of the following month:

- first, provide the substitution table used for the letters present in the plaintext
- second, describe how you broke this cipher
- third, describe and implement your own cipher system for encrypting and
  decrypting text files. you may use any programming language of your choice
  as part of the submission.

for the third part provide a live demonstration of your system.

- fourth, write a short report on the statistical letter frequencies of
  english in comparison with other languages. determine if english is
  considered the least random of most natural languages
